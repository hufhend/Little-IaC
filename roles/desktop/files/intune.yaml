# Microsoft Intune on Linux - What Can an Employer/Organization See and Do?
#
# 1. **Enforce Security Policies** - The organization can apply security settings such as disk encryption, firewall rules, and OS updates.
# 2. **Device Compliance Checks** - The system must meet corporate security requirements to access Microsoft 365 services.
# 3. **Block Access to Microsoft 365** - If the device is not enrolled in Intune or does not comply, access to company resources can be restricted.
# 4. **Remove Corporate Accounts** - The organization can revoke access to Microsoft 365 accounts and remove company data.
# 5. **Limited Visibility** - Unlike Windows, Intune on Linux does *not* allow full remote control, app installation, or remote wipe.
# 6. **No File Access or Monitoring** - The employer *cannot* view personal files, browser history, or general device usage.
# 7. **MDM (Mobile Device Management) Only** - Linux support is limited to compliance enforcement, with no deep system access.

# **Important**: If using a personal laptop, enrolling in Intune means the organization can enforce security policies 
# and potentially limit access to corporate services unless the device is managed.
