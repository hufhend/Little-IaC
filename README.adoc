These scripts were originally created as Ansible exercises. Later, they focused on automating Linux setup before installing a Kubernetes cluster. 

WARNING: The intended use is on a new bare metal installation of Linux, deployment on already running machines could be problematic.

== Quick Start

* First we clone the repository
+
`+git clone https://github.com/hufhend/ansible.git+`

* All playbooks and roles are relative is the root directory _ansible_, we enter it.
+
`+cd ansible+`

* Copy the sample variables, modify them as needed
+
`+cp -rfp sample/* .+`

* And simply run the first playbook 
+
`+ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml -l node06 setup.yaml+`

TIP: I recommend to try the functions in a non-production environment, for example via Vagrant.

== Detailed description

.Common parameters
|===
|Name |Description|Default value

|`+docker_user+`
|user for the docker role
|`+ansible_user+`

|`+role+`
|node role in the cluster: master or worker
|`+computer+`

|`+firewall+`
|decides whether to turn on the firewall
|`+false+`

|`+desktop+`
|determines if the computer is used by a human
|`+false+`


|`+cron+`
|enables crontab setting at K8s value
|`+choose+`
|===

The default setting of the _comuter_ role causes tasks from the cluster_node to not be executed. The required value should be set in host_vars.

== First launch
Before the first launch, we need to assign a new computer and user to run Ansible. A special playbook and roles are used for this.

=== Playbook host_init 
After a clean Linux installation, we usually have one regular user with sudo privileges. This is usually enough for us to manage the system from the command line, but for Ansible we need additional settings.
The host_init role sets the default user to run Ansible, uploads the ssh keys, adds it to sudoers, and sets the hostname.

==== Usage

`+ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml -l host07 host-init.yaml -kK+`

== Newly added features

5 May 2024 

* Added functionality to insert crontabs into K8s nodes, basic disk health check and update underlying systems including restart for maintenance
* Added example host_vars
